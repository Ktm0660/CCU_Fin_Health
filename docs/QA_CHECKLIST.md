# Manual QA Checklist

- Switch language, then navigate via header links, footer links, hero CTAs, and resource/lesson cards: the `lang` value should stay consistent in URLs and page content.
- Open and close the mobile menu; ensure links render and no errors appear.
- Run `npm run build` to confirm the project builds without errors.
