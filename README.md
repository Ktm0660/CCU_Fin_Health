# Connections Financial Health (CCU)
Warm, bilingual financial-health microsite with an assessment that scores Habits, Confidence, and Stability, plus tools and optional CU products.

## Local Dev
- npm install
- npm run dev
Then deploy to Vercel (Framework: Next.js, Root Directory: blank).

## Notes
- All assessment logic runs client-side; no PII is collected.
- Copy is intentionally friendly and judgment-free to build trust in rural/underserved communities.
